Dream Robot - SSHH 1.0
With almost everyone working and going to offices daily, there is a need to perform house hold shores timely and with accuracy. Apart from this, people generally tend to eat out after working long which doesn’t support good health. Also, with the decrease in fossil fuels, energy solutions need to be smart to take care of all the activities without using much electricity. To cater all the above mentioned problems, I came up with the solution of bringing up SSHH 1.0 – Self Sustainable House Holder.\\

Power source: The SSHH comes with a rechargeable battery but that’s not all. You’ll never have to charge the battery because it is a self-sustainable robot. It has three power sources.\
•	Solar Panel installed on the head\
•	Wind mill fan installed at the back which can also be used to provide cool air if reqd. \
•	Piezo electric material fitted in series along the tires which constantly generate electricity as it moves\
The SSHH is connected to a weather forecast app which gives it details about the sunshine or the wind speed regularly and it goes on to get some renewable energy, if not performing any task then.\

Other features of SSHH are:-\
•	The robot is normally of size 5 foots but because of its expendable arms and legs, it can reach a maximum height of 10 feet.\
•	It has a special purpose hand with individual function fingers like scissors, dust brush, all types of bottle opener and a suction finger that can grip anything. Other hand is a gripper arm which also has suction in it to strengthen the grip. \
•	The connection to the weather forecast app helps SSHH with the predicted weather and whenever a family member goes out of the home, SSHH asks them about the time in which they will return and advises a suitable apparel for corresponding weather.\
•	The special function hand, the gripper and the connection to the internet helps SSHH to chop vegetables, cook all types of food by self and use its taste sensor to taste the food before serving it.\
•	The vacuum tubes acting as legs sucks all the dirt and helps clean the floor while the extendable arms and legs can reach to all corners of the house and clean them thoroughly.\
•	SSHH follows dietary requirements of all family member keeping them healthy and helps with timely medication if necessary.\
•	SSHH has been designed to perform house hold shores like water the plants, dispose the garbage after distinguishing between recyclable and non-recyclable, do laundry and place the clothes back in the individual’s closet and uses an electrochemical smell sensor to spray room-freshener in case of foul smell.\
•	It has the feature of handling multiple e-mail accounts, contacts, messages of all family members individually and can return calls if instructed to. It also has the capability to place individual reminders and alarms for everyone in the family.\
•	It is configured such that it can control all the electronic devices of your house on your permission.\
•	The owner can go shopping with SSHH because it knows all the things required in the house and the kitchen. It has an inflatable bag that can be used to carry all the stuff. It also features a foldable hover board to which the owner can step on and doesn’t has to walk back home.\
•	It also has a holographic projector to display photos, videos, maps, movies or anything that a user wants to see.\
•	With the SSHH comes Micro Surveillance Devices (MSD) to be placed in each room. Each MSD is equipped with camera and voice & image recognition. Once a family member sitting in a room calls out SSHH working in a kitchen, the MSD will inform SSHH to come to the respective room. It also has the ability to detect water level in a jug and indicates SSHH to fill in water if the level is low. The MSD’s also work as baby monitor. SSHH charges the MSD’s one by one in the night once a week.\
•	The SSHH comes with in-built cameras, customizable speakers and a touch screen led for user interface. The SSHH can also be connected to the user’s phone and it can be instructed via phone calls or text message. A user also has the facility to watch live video through any of the micro surveillance device or SSHH’s eyes.\
•	The Soft robotics neck and the tire design gives SSHH a 360 degree movement whenever needed.\
•	SSHH comes with a human like voice box. The user has the option of using the male or the female voice.\

SSHH 1.0 comes with all the things required in a house holder. It just doesn’t do all the house shores accurately, it takes care of the family.
